All model checkpoint weights were used when initializing GeneralizedRCNN.

All the weights of GeneralizedRCNN were initialized from the model checkpoint at unc-nlp/frcnn-vg-finetuned.
If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use GeneralizedRCNN for predictions without further training.
Some weights of the model checkpoint at unc-nlp/lxmert-base-uncased were not used when initializing LxmertModel: ['answer_head.logit_fc.0.bias', 'answer_head.logit_fc.0.weight', 'answer_head.logit_fc.2.bias', 'answer_head.logit_fc.2.weight', 'answer_head.logit_fc.3.bias', 'answer_head.logit_fc.3.weight', 'cls.predictions.bias', 'cls.predictions.decoder.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight', 'obj_predict_head.decoder_dict.attr.bias', 'obj_predict_head.decoder_dict.attr.weight', 'obj_predict_head.decoder_dict.feat.bias', 'obj_predict_head.decoder_dict.feat.weight', 'obj_predict_head.decoder_dict.obj.bias', 'obj_predict_head.decoder_dict.obj.weight', 'obj_predict_head.transform.LayerNorm.bias', 'obj_predict_head.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'obj_predict_head.transform.dense.bias', 'obj_predict_head.transform.dense.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing LxmertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing LxmertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.52, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.
